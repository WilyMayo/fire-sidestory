    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
       And we initialized our entire hard drive to git hub.
       The thunder broke the silent of the room. We all stood up in fear.
       Al came over and held us to his bosom, and said in a sweet whisper "Shhh my child... it will be ok." As we feel a minute of calm and at easy. The door slammed open and a dark shadow stood there.
