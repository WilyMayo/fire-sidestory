    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
       And we initialized our entire hard drive to git hub.
       The thunder broke the silence of the room. We all stood up in fear.
       Al came over and held us to his bosom and said in a sweet whisper "Shhh my child... it will be ok."
       For a moment we feel calm and at ease. The door slammed open and a dark shadow was standing in the doorway.
